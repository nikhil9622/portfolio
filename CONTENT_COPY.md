### **Personal Story Section**

**Content:**
```
I'm Nikhil Chandan, a final-year Computer Science & Cybersecurity 
student at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Chennai. My journey into 
cybersecurity began with a simple question: "How can we make systems 
defend themselves intelligently?"

That curiosity led me to build ZERA, an agentic security chatbot that 
doesn't just detect threats—it reasons about them, maps them to known 
attack patterns, and takes action with human oversight. It's the 
intersection of AI, security operations, and real-world impact.

Beyond code, I've led an 8-member team in rural Assam, conducting 
field research on sustainable farming practices. I've mentored peers 
in digital forensics, organized national tech fests, and competed in 
hackathons across India. Each experience has taught me that great 
security isn't just about code—it's about people, processes, and 
continuous learning.

I believe in building systems that are secure by design, transparent 
in operation, and empowering for their users.

### **Project 1: ZERA - Agentic Security Chatbot**

**Project Title:**
```
ZERA - Zero-Endpoint Risk Agent
Agentic Security Chatbot for Endpoint Risk Remediation
```

**Overview:**
```
ZERA is an intelligent security agent that monitors endpoint health, 
scores risks in real-time, maps threats to MITRE ATT&CK tactics, and 
executes remediation plans with user approval. Built with LLM reasoning, 
it bridges the gap between threat detection and automated response.
```

**The Problem:**
```
Traditional endpoint security tools generate alerts but require manual 
investigation and remediation. Security teams are overwhelmed with 
alerts, and response times lag—allowing threats to persist.
```

**The Solution:**
```
ZERA automates the entire threat response lifecycle:
1. **Real-Time Risk Scoring** - Analyzes endpoint signals continuously
2. **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping** - Maps threats to known tactics (e.g., T1036, T1105)
3. **Severity Banding** - Categorizes risks (Low, Medium, High, Critical)
4. **AI-Driven Remediation** - LLM generates structured JSON remediation plans
5. **User Approval Workflow** - Human-in-the-loop for critical actions
6. **Automated Execution** - Endpoint agent runs allow-listed fixes
7. **Immutable Audit Trail** - Logs every action (prompt → plan → result)
```

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Real-time endpoint risk scoring
- ✅ MITRE ATT&CK framework integration
- ✅ LLM-powered remediation planning
- ✅ Human-in-the-loop approval system
- ✅ Automated fix execution (DNS flush, process kill, Defender updates)
- ✅ JWT-based org-scoped access control
- ✅ Complete audit trail for compliance

**Tech Stack:**
```
Backend: Python
AI/LLM: GPT-based reasoning engine
Security: MITRE ATT&CK API, JWT authentication
Endpoint: Windows Defender, DNS, Process Management
Database: MongoDB (audit logs)
```

**Impact:**
```
📉 Reduced response time from hours to minutes
🎯 90% of low/medium threats auto-remediated
🔒 100% audit compliance with immutable logs
⚡ Real-time threat visibility across endpoints

### **Project 2: Drug Response Prediction in Cancer Cell Lines**

**Project Title:**
```
Cancer Drug Response Prediction
Deep Learning for Personalized Medicine
```

**Overview:**
```
A deep learning framework that predicts how cancer cell lines respond 
to specific drugs, enabling personalized treatment recommendations. 
Combines CNN and RNN architectures to analyze genomic, molecular, 
and clinical features.
```

**The Problem:**
```
Cancer treatment is often trial-and-error. Predicting drug sensitivity 
before administration can save time, reduce side effects, and improve 
patient outcomes—but requires analyzing complex multi-modal data.
```

**The Solution:**
```
Built a hybrid CNN-RNN model that:
1. **Integrates Multiple Datasets** - GDSC1, GDSC2, AACR GENIE
2. **Processes Genomic Features** - Mutations, gene expression, copy number
3. **Analyzes Molecular Data** - Drug chemical properties
4. **Predicts Sensitivity Metrics** - LN_IC50, AUC, RMSE, Z-SCORE
5. **Validates on Real Patients** - Clinical data from AACR GENIE
```

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Multi-dataset integration (GDSC1, GDSC2, AACR)
- ✅ Hybrid CNN-RNN architecture
- ✅ Genomic + molecular feature fusion
- ✅ Predicts 4 key sensitivity metrics
- ✅ Real patient data validation

**Tech Stack:**
```
Framework: TensorFlow, Keras
Models: CNN, RNN, Hybrid architectures
Data Processing: NumPy, Pandas
Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Platform: Google Colab, Kaggle
```

**Datasets:**
- **GDSC1 & GDSC2** - Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer
- **AACR GENIE** - Clinical genomic database

**Results:**
```
📊 High accuracy in predicting LN_IC50 values
🎯 AUC scores validated against clinical outcomes
📈 RMSE improved by 15% over baseline models
🧬 Successfully predicted sensitivity for 200+ drugs
```

**Date:** November 2024

### **Project 3: Phishing Email Detection**

**Project Title:**
```
ML-Powered Phishing Email Detection
Protecting Users from Social Engineering Attacks
```

**Overview:**
```
A machine learning system that detects phishing emails by analyzing 
textual content and metadata. Uses SVM and Random Forest classifiers 
to identify malicious emails with high accuracy.
```

**The Problem:**
```
Phishing emails are the #1 attack vector for data breaches. Traditional 
spam filters miss sophisticated phishing attempts that mimic legitimate 
communication.
```

**The Solution:**
```
Built a dual-classifier system:
1. **Feature Extraction** - Text analysis (keywords, urgency, links)
2. **Metadata Analysis** - Sender domain, header anomalies
3. **SVM Classifier** - Linear separation of phishing vs. legitimate
4. **Random Forest** - Ensemble learning for robustness
5. **Real-Time Classification** - Fast prediction for email clients
```

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Dual classifier approach (SVM + Random Forest)
- ✅ Text + metadata feature engineering
- ✅ 94% detection accuracy
- ✅ Low false positive rate (<3%)
- ✅ Real-time classification

**Tech Stack:**
```
Language: Python
Libraries: Scikit-learn, NLTK, Pandas
Algorithms: SVM, Random Forest
Features: TF-IDF, N-grams, Metadata parsing
```

**Results:**
```
✅ 94% accuracy on test dataset
⚡ <100ms average classification time
📧 Analyzed 10,000+ email samples
🔍 2.8% false positive rate
```
